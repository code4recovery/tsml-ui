# TSML UI &nbsp; [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/code4recovery/tsml-ui/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/code4recovery/tsml-ui?branch=main)

TSML UI (12 Step Meeting List User Interface) is an interactive meeting finder makes the [12 Step Meeting List](https://github.com/code4recovery/12-step-meeting-list) interface available for use on any web page, regardless of platform.

Here are two demos:

- [San Francisco / Marin](https://aasfmarin.org/meetings) (uses a custom database as a data source)

- [Santa Cruz](https://aasantacruz.org/meeting-guide/) (WordPress / 12 Step Meeting List data source)

To use TSML UI on your website you only need to add some HTML to your web page. To get started, use our [configuration instructions](https://tsml-ui.code4recovery.org).

## Configure

### Enable "Near Me" mode

You don't need to do anything other than enable HTTPS on your website. To ensure all users see this functionality, make sure that anyone who enters a `http://` address for your site is redirected to the `https://` address.

### Add custom types

Here is an example of extending the `tsml_react_config` object to include a definition for an additional meeting type.

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  strings: {
    en: {
      types: {
        BEACH: 'Beach Meeting',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

A.A. groups that wish to participate in the Meeting Guide app should be careful not to repurpose types already in use. A full list of A.A. meeting types can be found in the [Meeting Guide format spec](https://github.com/code4recovery/spec).

### Override type descriptions

A.A. meeting type descriptions are automatically applied to Open and Closed types. These can be unset or overwritten as needed.

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  strings: {
    en: {
      type_descriptions: {
        O: 'This is a custom Open description',
        C: undefined, //this type description has been unset
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Override type defaults

If you wanted to add a list that is pre-filtered to a single type, "Women" in this example, you can add this code:

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  defaults: { type: ['women'] },
  show: {
    controls: false,
    title: false,
  },
};
```

### Use kilometers

Distances can be calculated in miles (`mi`) or kilometers (`km`).

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  distance_unit: 'km',
};
```

### Disable Add to Calendar button

You can disable the add to calendar button if needed.

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  calendar_enabled: false,
};
```

### Change the map style

Open Street Maps can be styled by picking a different tile layer URL and attribution and adding them to the `tsml_react_config` object. There are several free and paid tile layers [listed here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  map: {
    tiles: {
      attribution:
        '&copy; <a href="https://www.stadiamaps.com/" target="_blank">Stadia Maps</a> &copy; <a href="https://openmaptiles.org/" target="_blank">OpenMapTiles</a> &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors',
      url: 'https://tiles.stadiamaps.com/tiles/alidade_smooth_dark/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png',
    },
  },
};
```

You can optionally specify a `tiles_dark` attribute which will be used when `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  map: {
    tiles_dark: {
      attribution: '&copy; ...',
      url: 'https://...',
    },
  },
};
```

If you prefer the Mapbox map appearance (we switched away from Mapbox in May 2025), you can add this to your site (just replace `<pk.your.access.token>` with your Mabpox access token):

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  map: {
    tiles: {
      attribution: `Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, Imagery © <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>`,
      url: 'https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/streets-v11/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=<pk.your.access.token>',
    },
    tiles_dark: {
      attribution: `Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, Imagery © <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>`,
      url: 'https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/dark-v10/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=<pk.your.access.token>',
    },
  },
};
```

Markers can be adjusted by supplying an alternate SVG image:

```js
var tsml_react_config = {
  map: {
    markers: {
      location: {
        html: `<svg…`,
        height: 48,
        width: 12,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Customize theme colors

You can use CSS variables to customize TSML UI’s appearance. Here are the defaults:

```css
#tsml-ui {
  --alert-background: #faf4e0;
  --alert-text: #998a5e;
  --background: #fff;
  --border-radius: 4px;
  --focus: #0d6efd40;
  --font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --font-size: 16px;
  --in-person: #146c43;
  --inactive: #b02a37;
  --link: #0d6efd;
  --online: #0a58ca;
  --online-background-image: url(https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588196749597-9ff075ee6b5b?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=crop&fm=jpg&h=1440&ixid=MnwxfDB8MXxhbGx8fHx8fHx8fHwxNjIyMTIzODkw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&utm_campaign=api-credit&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash_source&w=1920);
  --text: #212529;
}
```

Only specify the variables you wish to override in your code. Hex values (`#123456`) must be used when specifiying colors.

### Dark mode

If your website theme supports responsive dark mode, TSML UI can match it with a media query: In [this demo](https://tsml-ui.code4recovery.org/tests/aasanjose.html) the background will be white if the user prefers a light appearance, and black if they prefer dark.

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  #tsml-ui {
    --background: #000;
    --color: #fff;
    --link: #7bc8ff;
  }
}
```

### Change the online background image

This image will be shown instead of a map for online meetings. Should be roughly 2000px wide and tall.

```css
#tsml-ui {
  --online-background-image: url(/path/to/image.jpg);
}
```

To remove:

```css
#tsml-ui {
  --online-background-image: none;
}
```

## Frequently asked questions

### How do timezones work?

If you are only listing meetings in a single timezone, e.g. Philadelphia, PA, then you should specify a `data-timezone` attribute in your embed code. This must be in the proper [IANA timezone format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) e.g. `America/New_York`. TSML UI will assume that any meetings without a specified timezone are in that zone.

However if your site lists meetings in a variety of timezones, and you have a timezone key/column in your meeting data, then you may omit the `data-timezone` attribute and times will be translated into the user's timezone.

Note: The WordPress plugin 12 Step Meeting List does not yet support timezone keys in meeting data.

### How are metatypes like "Active" and "Online" calculated?

Metatypes are types that are not specified explicitly in the data, they are inferred from the data based on this logic:

- A meeting is considered `In-Person` if it doesn't have a type of `Location Temporarily Closed` and it has a specific street address.

- A meeting is considered `Online` if it has a `conference_url` that matches our recognized formats and/or it has a `conference_phone`

- A meeting is considered `Active` if it's `In-Person` or `Online`, otherwise it's `Inactive`.

### Why no "Hybrid" type?

This app exists to help people find A.A. meetings, and after much discussion we decided that Hybrid was not a useful filter type for that purpose. We believe that people on the whole do not set out looking for a hybrid meeting, they simply want to know whether their online or in-person meeting happens to be hybrid. They will know this by its appearance in the list.

Second, while we can infer that a meeting is "online" if there is a Zoom URL (for example) in the listing, the app should not assume that, when there are online and in-person options, that means it is an actual "hybrid" meeting with a video screen and speakers in the room.

Web servants may [add their own meeting types](#add-custom-types) of course.

### What is Speaker/Discussion?

When meetings are tagged both Speaker (`SP`) and Discussion (`D`), TSML UI merges them into a combined Speaker/Discussion type. This enables users to use existing filters to locate Speaker-only and Discussion-only meetings.

### Can I import TSML UI from NPM for use in a NextJS or Gatsby project?

Not yet! Please open a pull request and walk us through the process of adding it to NPM and we'll give it a shot.
